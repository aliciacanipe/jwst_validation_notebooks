# JWST Validation Notebooks

This repository contains notebook that are used to validate the output of the JWST Calibration Pipeline. These notebooks are structured to capture documentation, code and figures and other outputs that will need to be inspected by eye by members of the JWST instrument teams.

These notebooks follow a consistent [style guide](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/guides/jupyter-notebooks.md) in terms of layout/structure, coding conventions etc.

## Contents
